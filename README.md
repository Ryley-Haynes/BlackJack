# Blackjack Game Implementation in Java

This repository contains the implementation of a **Blackjack** game in Java. The project uses a deck of cards to simulate a classic game of Blackjack, including functionality for shuffling, dealing cards, and determining the outcome of a game.

## Features

- Supports standard Blackjack rules:
  - Player and dealer receive initial two cards.
  - Player and dealer can draw additional cards.
  - Automatic handling of Ace values (1 or 11).
  - Detects game results: win, lose, push, bust, or natural blackjack.
- Modular and extensible design using classes like `Deck`, `Card`, and `BlackjackModel`.
- Hand assessment and game logic implemented with reusable utility methods.
